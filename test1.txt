Beetlejuice is back! After an unexpected family tragedy, three generations of the Deetz family return to their home in Winter River. Still haunted by Beetlejuice, Lydia's life takes a turn when her rebellious teenage daughter, Astrid, discovers the mysterious model of the town in the attic, accidentally opening the portal to the Afterlife. With trouble brewing in both realms, it's only a matter of time before someone says Beetlejuice's name three times, and the mischievous demon returns to unleash his own kind of chaos.
